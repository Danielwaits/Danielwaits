**SwagLabs**

In this project I conducted exploratory testing on the Swag Labs website to evaluate the user experience and functionality. My capstone included creating test plans, test cases, bugs and manual testing. I was able to test the website and the following features: Login and Password input fields, user experience with navigating the online store, match between product image and text, and functionality of the shopping cart.
