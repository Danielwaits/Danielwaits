ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Danielwaits



## About Me
I am organized, structured and attentive to detail due to my background in home inspection. I'm a positive thinker, who can use analytical thinking skills and strong deductive reasoning. I'm determined, and enjoy working with people. A curious question asker, I enjoy solving problems.

As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I love to plan and go on fun adventures that challenge me on a daily basis. The thrill of the unknown is the funnest part.
