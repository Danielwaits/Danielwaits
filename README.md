- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Danielwaits
About Me
I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background in home inspection. I'm a postive thinker, who can use analitical thinking skills. Strong deductive reasoning and a top-down logic problem solving structure. I'm determined, enjoy working with people.
Curious question asker, and enjoy solving problems.

As a avid outdoor enthuist, i love to plan and go on fun adventures, that challenge me on a daily basis. The thrill of the unkonwn is the funest part.
